# Express.js Route Handler Missing Database Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for database operations within route handlers.  Failure to properly handle potential errors from database interactions can lead to application crashes or, worse, silent failures that are difficult to debug.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Simulate a database error (e.g., by intentionally causing a database connection failure or making a query that will not find data).
5. Observe the unhandled error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the corrected code, providing a robust approach to handling database errors. A `try...catch` block is used to gracefully handle any potential exceptions and respond appropriately to the client.
